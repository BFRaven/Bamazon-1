# Bamazon
Bamazon is an Amazon-like storefront CLI application that will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory.

## Customer Experience
The customer is able to enter the 'Bamazon Shop' and view all items for sale.  Upon viewing the sale items, the customer is then prompted for the ID of the item they would like to buy, as well as the quantity.  Once the customer inputs their requested item's ID and quantity, Bamazon adds together their total, and shows them the total invoice. 

_If there is *insufficient quantity* of the requested item in Bamazon's database, the user will be alerted of insufficient quantity, and asked whether or not they would like to continue shopping._

Once the transaction is complete, the customer will be asked if they would like to continue shopping.  If yes, the customer will be given the new stock inventory of Bamazon and allowed to place another order.  If not, they will be thanked for shopping Bamazon!
